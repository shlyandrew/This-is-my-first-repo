## Journal for Code Fellows
### BIO
I am 37, single, born and raised in FL. I live a quiet home with one roommate in Orlando, FL. I know it is cliche to say, but honestly I am very quiet and shy until you get to know me. I was in the Marine Corps from 04 - 09. Afterwords, I worked for the Orlando VA Medical Center as an Administrative Assistant, where I taught myself a bit of coding to help with some of my daily administrative tasks. I decided to dedicate myself to this new career path because I was able to successful create and utilize a few projects and enjoyed the process. I look forward to learning and working with the rest of my classmates.

## GROWTH MINDSET :thinking:

To me, growth mindset is maintaing the compacity to learn something new, knowthing that thing is new to you and that you may fail at it, but keeping a positive mentality and figuring out a way to find the answers to your quiries. Growth Mindset is not allowing yourself to be stuck on a problem for longer than 15 minutes before utilizing a different method to answer the questions. It tis knowing that  should be having a "sandbox experiebce" which is laerning things as I go and not knowing all of the answers at first.

## 3 Ways to Keep Myself in the Growth Mindset :nerd_face:

* I am going to make sure I reach out to my instructor whenever I feel like I am not able to figure out the answer to an issue on my own. I know that my instrucdtor will be there to assist me whenever I need it, though I do not want to reay to heavily on her, as part of the mindset it knowing I can potentially discover the answer to my problem myself
* I will rely on the assistance of my fellow classmates whenever I am attempting anything that becomes too difficult for me. I know that we are all in this together, and that some students will have strengths in areas where others do not, so it would behove me to illicit their assistance. It will help me to grow and learn to do so, and will help me to learn by helping them if asksed as well. 
* Stepping away from an issue that I have been stuck on for more that 15 minutes is a great way of remaining confident in my abilities to solve the problem. This concept stuck out most for me, as it is one that I had not thought of before. It makes a lot of sense to not allow yourself to spend too much time on one issue if you are wracking your brain trying to figure out the answer, and coming up with nothing. If I come across this issue, I will be sure to step away after about 15 minutes, and come back to it with assistance, or just a new mindset after refreshing myself.
