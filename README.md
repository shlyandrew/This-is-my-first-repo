My reading ##journal for Code Fellows
I am 37, single, born and raised in FL. I live a quiet home with one roommate in Orlando, FL. I know it is cliche to say, but honestly I am very quiet and shy until you get to know me. I was in the Marine Corps from 04 - 09. Afterwords, I worked for the Orlando VA Medical Center as an Administrative Assistant, where I taught myself a bit of coding to help with some of my daily administrative tasks. I decided to dedicate myself to this new career path because I was able to successful create and utilize a few projects and enjoyed the process. I look forward to learning and working with the rest of my classmates.
